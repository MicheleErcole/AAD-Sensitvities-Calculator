# Master-s-Thesis-Project
This project provides a Java implementation of the Sensitivities-Based Method (SBM) of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) framework, integrating Automatic Adjoint Differentiation (AAD) to compute exact derivatives for delta, vega, and curvature risk measures.
The implementation is applied to an equity portfolio containing cash equities, European options, and Bermudan options.
